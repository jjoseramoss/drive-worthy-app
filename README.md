# DriveWorthy

DriveWorthy is a simple app designed to help you figure out if a used car listing is actually worth checking out. Buying a used car can be overwhelming — prices get inflated, listings hide problems, and it’s hard to know what’s a good deal without digging deep. This app aims to make that process easier and smarter.

## Why I’m Building This

I’ve been there — scrolling through tons of Facebook Marketplace car ads, unsure which ones are real deals and which ones will cost a fortune to fix. I wanted an easy way to get a trusted, quick assessment so I don’t waste time chasing lemons.  

This project is as much about learning as it is about solving a real problem I face.
